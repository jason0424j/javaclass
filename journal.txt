today i learn that how to write the code and how the code means to our computer. 
all the code have to follow steps and if you use the capital latter, you must use
 the capital latter at the bottom. i learn that how the code will translate to that 
us understand. everthing must be correct, other wise the computer can't translate 
into the word that we understand.
